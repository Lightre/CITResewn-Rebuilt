### About CITResewn Rebuilt

This is a fork of [**CITResewn**](https://modrinth.com/mod/cit-resewn), rebuilt to work with **Minecraft 1.21.2+** on
Fabric.  
Just like the original, it allows resource packs to swap how items look under certain conditions (Custom Item Textures,
CIT).

It works without MCPatcher or OptiFine. **This version is actively in development**, so features may change and bugs are
expected.
